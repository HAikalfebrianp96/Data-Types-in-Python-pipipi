## **A Brief History of Python **
Python was first created by Guido van Rossum at the Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Python is inspired by the ABC programming language. Until now, Guido is still the main author for python, even though it is open source so thousands of people also contributed to its development. The name python itself does not come from the name of the snake we know. Guido is a fan of the British comedy group Monty Python. He then named his creation language Python.

## **Advantages of Python**


*   Python is relatively easy to learn and use compared to other programming languages. The syntax is simple, easy to read and remember because the python philosophy itself emphasizes the readability aspect. Python code is easy to write and easy to read, so it's easier to fix if something goes wrong, and easy to maintain.

*   Besides being easier to read, python is also more efficient than other languages ​​such as C, C++, and Java. To do something with 5 lines of code in another language, it may take only 1 line of code in python. This causes programming in Python to be more concise and faster than other languages.

*   Python is a multifunctional language. With python you can do various things from processing text, creating websites, creating network programs, robotics, data mining, to artificial intelligence. With python you can create desktop-based and smartphone-based applications.

*   Python is a popular programming language. As of September 2018, Python is the 3rd most popular programming language in the world.

## **Variables A**
variable is a location in memory to store a value that can be populated with data or objects.

In python, variable declaration or creation happens automatically when we assign a value to a variable. The equals sign ( = ) is used to assign values ​​to variables. The operation to the left of the equal sign is the name of the variable, and to the right of the equal sign is the value stored in the variable.

## **Data Types** 
There are three basic data types in python, namely Number, String, and Boolean.
We can use the type() function to find out the data type of an object in Python.

## **Number **

*   In python there are two basic data types: related to numbers and very often encountered, namely float, int and complex. Float or floating point is a decimal number, while int or integer is an integer, while Complex is a number in mathematics.

*  Numeric data type which consists of three (3) types, such as Integer, Float, and Complex. data types are used to handle numeric in Python.

*  Integer is a numeric type that represents all positive and negative integers, such as 1,2,3.-1,-2,-3 and so on.

*  The float type in Python, designates a floating-point number. float values are specified with a decimal point, float type data example:3.14.

*  Number types in Python also support imaginary numbers and complex numbers. Complex numbers are written in the formulation x + yj.

## **String**
string data type is a data type that consists of a set of characters. In python this data type is usually put in quotation marks at the beginning and end of the character set. if the character set is enclosed in quotation marks it will be immediately classified as a string.

## **Conclusion**

In Python, data types are used to classify one particular type of data, specifying the values ​​you can assign to the type and the operations you can perform on it. When programming, there are times when we need to convert values ​​of different types to manipulate values ​​in different ways. For example, we may need to concatenate a numeric value with a string, or represent a decimal place in a number that is initialized as an integer value
